          <h2>The long version</h2>
          <p>I'm a designer and developer, but it seems I never can quite nail down an official title for myself. Web designer, interaction designer, front-end engineer, UI developer... the labels I see tossed around on the web never feel right. Some might call me a "design hacker". Essentially, I'm a coder who designs and a designer who codes.</p>
          <p>My coder half loves writing HTML and CSS—I've been doing so since I was about 12, and professionally now for about six years. I've written a fair amount of framework-based JavaScript (mostly jQuery) during that time, but recently, I've been learning JavaScript from the ground up in an attempt to wield it properly. I also enjoy working on the back end. Early on, I slogged around in surface-level PHP (primarily via Drupal and WordPress), but then I discovered Python, Django, and the joys of microframeworks. I'm always eager to dive in and learn new frameworks, tools, and languages. (I don't claim to be an expert back end developer, but I love to work with them!)</p>
          <p>My designer half loves building elegant, sensible interfaces, and I'm a vocal advocate for the user. I'm comfortable in every stage of the design process, from initial concept to wireframing, rapid prototyping, and usability testing. This summer, I completed my BFA in Graphic Design at Colorado State University, where I became intimately familiar with branding and identity, typography, layout, and color theory. Of course, I'm also extremely proficient with the tools of the trade: InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop.</p>
          <p>At CSU, I took (and loved) classes in branding and identity, layout, typography, and color theory. However, because of my long background working on the web, I also pursued my own studies in user interface and user experience, gobbling up books like [Don't Make Me Think], [Designed for Use], [Getting Real]... I discovered a particular passion and penchant for typography, one that significantly (informs, drives?) my work on the web.</p>
